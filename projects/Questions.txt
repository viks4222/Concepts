Classes and Objects 
Constructors and Destructor	
Copy Constructor- shallow copy and deep copy
Constructor initilizer list (for nonstatic  const & reference variables) and the initilisation inside the constructor
copy constructor and assignment operator.
Why we need cp ctr ?
When cpy ctr gets called ?
Can you hv pur virtual dtor ?
Cpy ctor for with char ptr ?
When we can't create an object for a pure virtual function then what is the use of pure virtual destructor
Operator overloading (=) , how to avoid leaks in this
Virtual Constructors and destructors

OOPS Concepts:
abstraction and interfaces and its use.
access specifier-private,protected,public
class with pointer member functions
Size of empty class, class with one virtual function
Can char* point to an empty class?
what is this pointer, can it be deleted?
Abstract class
interface
virtual functions
Vtble and vptr
Virtual table and pointers
example of real time polymorphism ,encapsulation,abstraction,inheritance
private inheritance?? And real time scenario examples?? When should we mainly use??
Employee class with setter getter and inheritance


Design pattern in details:
Creational patterns:
1.Singleton Design Pattern-
why methods are static in singleton , why constructor is set private, why use singleton pattern
2.factory Pattern
Structural patterns:
Behavioural patterns:
state ,observer
1.      Singleton
2.      Factory
3.      Adaptor
4.      Observer

References
References (interview question with examples)
References and pointer
passsing by ref and passing by pointer
How do you initialise a reference?
dangling pointer
9)Pointers-void,far,near,wild,uninitialized pttr, NULL
Auto-ptr and shared_ptr
Casting in c++
 Casting â€“ Different kinds and in depth
understanding (with example)
Static, extern, const how they are initialize
static members and functions
static class ?
const members and functions

Template
What is spacialise template?
STLs
types of STL's
difference between map & vector
Vector operations 
Dynamic Memory Allocation
Heap Memory and Stack Memory
Exception handling
UML diagrams:
UML diagram for a company and class diagram
Data Structures:
String class and its functions.
Difference betn new and malloc
difference between array and linked list
Write a program  for linked list, queue,
stack
1.Postfix Prefix ,expressions and associativity
2.linked list-insertion,deletion,reversal
Sorting algo:- quick,selection,bubble, insertion

Multithreading- pthread , thread sync,thread mutex,thread management,pthread API's
used -lpthread in linux to link programs ,present in std library for windows
Mutex - a variable for IPC and synchronization
Semaphore - a variable for specifying set of operations to be done in mutual excusion fork - to fork a child process
vfork - to fork a child process, and to guarantee the child executes first so that the child address space can be replaced by entirely new process by any of exec family of call
GTEST fwk

Programs:
