The rule of thumb - if we have a class with a virtual function, it needs a virtual destructor. Why?

If a class has a virtual function, it is likely to be used as a base class.
If it is a base class, its derived class is likely to be allocated using new.
If a derived class object is allocated using new and manipulated through a pointer to its base, it is likely to be deleted via a pointer to its base.


using virtual destructors ensures that the correct sequence of destructors is called.
