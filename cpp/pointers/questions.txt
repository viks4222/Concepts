What are the differences between a pointer variable and a reference variable in C++?

pointer is a an integer variable which stores address of another variable. 
it can be NULL, and can be any type void , char or int etc.
pointer does not need to be initialized. 
pointers can be reseated, i.e. a pointer can be assigned to different variables in its life cycle.
pointers are less safer as they can be NULL or pointing to any arbitrary location.


reference is a variable alias
References are like constant pointers , once initialized the reference cannot point to another variable in that life cycle.
Reference must be initialized and thus safer to use.
Pass by reference is widely used to avoid creating temporary copy of argument passed, this is useful when large size arguments
are passed in function.

Use:

Use references in function parameters and return types to provide useful and self-documenting interfaces.
Use pointers for implementing algorithms and data structures.
