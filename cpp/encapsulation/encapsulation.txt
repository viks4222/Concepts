Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a process of wrapping of  data members and functions 
in a single unit called class. This is to prevent the access to the data directly, the access to them is 
provided through the functions of the class.
eg.
1) Make all the data members private.
2) Create public setter and getter functions for each data member in such a way that the set function 
	set the value of data member and get function get the value of data member.


Implementation Difference Between Encapsulation and Abstraction

1.  Abstraction is implemented using interface and abstract class while Encapsulation is implemented using private and 
protected access modifier.

2. OOPS makes use of encapsulation to enforce the integrity of a type (i.e. to make sure data is used in an 
appropriate manner) by preventing programmers from accessing data 
in a non-intended manner. Through encapsulation, only a predetermined group of functions can access the data.
 The collective term for datatypes and operations (methods) bundled together with access restrictions (public/private, etc.) 
 is a class.
