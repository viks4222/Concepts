Static Factory Method:

object without exposing the creation logic to client and the client use the same common interface to create new type of object.
The idea is to use a static member-function (static factory method) which creates & returns instances, 
hiding the details of class modules from user.

A factory pattern is one of the core design principles to create an object, allowing clients to create objects of a 
library(explained below) in a way such that it doesnÅft have tight coupling with the class hierarchy of the library.

What is meant when we talk about library and clients?
A library is something which is provided by some third party which exposes some public APIs and clients make calls to 
those public APIs to complete its task. A very simple example can be different kinds of Views provided by Android OS.

Ex. 
Drivers for USB , SD , etc
video audio engines., multimedia plugins
