1.SEARCHING:
linear search: compares for every ele.
binary search :
	recursively searches for the data within a set of ele (lb,ub)  using mid .
	mid = lb + (ub-lb)/2
	(arr[mid]> data)
			-> binary_search()
	
	
jump_search:

take step = sqrt(MAX_SIZE);








2.SORTING:

bubble sort:
swapping two adjacent ele. 


selection sort:
swap minindex and bring it to the sorted position.


insertion sort:
card anomaly
put unsorted ele to sorted array.
