Bubble sort:
	sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
	Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.
	Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted
	
	
Selection Sort:
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part 
and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
1) The subarray which is already sorted.
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.
In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to 
the sorted subarray.



Insertion Sort:	
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
